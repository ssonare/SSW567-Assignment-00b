Challenges
- Handling the triangle inequality correctly.
- Checking for right triangles while avoiding floating-point errors.
- Deciding how to combine "Right" with other triangle types in the output.

Requirements Specification
- The requirements were clear and gave a simple framework. 
- Including "Right" alongside type required careful planning.

Tool Challenges
- Initial issues importing the main function into the test file.
- Remembering to run tests using `unittest` syntax.

Test Coverage Criteria
- Tested all triangle types (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, Right).
- Tested invalid triangles (negative or zero sides, triangle inequality failures).
- Added edge cases for Isosceles Right triangles.
- Once all tests passed without errors, we considered the testing sufficient.
